<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>
    <h3>
    Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network.

<ul>
    <li>White Hat Hackers (Cyber-Security Hacker)</li>
    <li>Black Hat Hackers (Cracker) </li>
    <li>Gray Hat Hackers (Both)</li>
    
</ul>

    <h2>
    <li>White Hat Hackers:</li></h2>
    <img src="./white hat.jpg" alt=""width="550px"height="350px">
    <ul>
        <li> <b>White hat hackers</b>generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. </li>
        <li>They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers. </li>
        <li>To become a white hat hacker, you can earn a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology, or cybersecurity. In addition, certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) are highly recommended.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
    <li>Black Hat Hackers:</li></h2>
    <img src="./black hat.jpg" alt=""height="350px"width="550px">
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Black hat hackers </b>unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. </li>
        <li>They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain.</li>
        <li>They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <li>Gray Hat Hackers:</li></h2>
        <img src="./gray hat.jpg" alt=""width="550px"height="350px">
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Gray hat hackers </b>sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. </li>
            <li>The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company.One criticism of Grey Hat hackers is that their actions can still cause harm.</li>
            <li>Even if they do not steal or damage data, their unauthorized access to computer systems can still disrupt operations and cause financial losses for companies. Additionally, there is always the risk that a Grey Hat hacker will accidentally cause damage while attempting to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>

<h1>Types of hacking:</h1>
<p>Hacking is something from which you’ve to protect yourself and solely can be done by anticipating how a hacker might think to get into the system.</p>
<ol>
    <li><h2> <a href="https://www.phishing.org/what-is-phishing">Phishing:</a></li></h2>
    <p>This is a type of email attack in which an attacker tries to find sensitive information of users in a fraud manner through electronic communication by pretending to be from a related trusted organization. Emails are carefully designed by attackers to target a group and clicking on a link installs malicious code on the computer. </p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li> Stealing bank transaction passwords from users</li>
    <li> Stealing login credentials from users</li>
</ul>
    <li> <h2><b> <a href="https://hackersonlineclub.com/virus-types/">Virus:</a></h2></b></li>
    <p>These are triggered by the hacker into the filters of the website once they enter into it . The purpose is to corrupt the information or resources on the net website.A virus is a self-replicating program that produces its own copy by attaching itself to another program, computer boot sector or document.</p>
    <p> <b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Worm,SQL Slammer</li>
    <li>CryptoLocker,Tinba</li>
</ul>
    <li> <h2><b> <a href="https://nordvpn.com/cybersecurity/glossary/cookie-theft/#:~:text=Cookie%20theft%20refers%20to%20a,number%2C%20and%20other%20sensitive%20information.">Cookie theft:</a></b></h2></li>
    <p>Hackers access the net website exploitation malicious codes and steal cookies that contain tips, login passwords, etc. Get access to your account then will do any factor besides your account.Cookie theft refers to a cyberattack where a hacker gets access to the user's cookie data, small files websites store on the user's device. Cookie theft (also called cookie hijacking) can result in the attacker gaining access to the user's name, home address, telephone number, and other sensitive information.</p>
</ul>   
    <p><b>Examples:</p></b>
<ul>
    <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</li>
    <li>A man-in-the-middle attack </li>
</ul>

<p>In today's digital landscape, ethical hacking is essential for organizations to ensure the security and protection of their data and systems. It provides numerous benefits and can help to prevent devastating consequences such as data breaches and financial loss.Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.</p>
